When we are doing the lab with two processors, we connected the LCD to BUS3 on the slave board, which made the communication between two boards invalid. We could not receive anything from the master processor or send anything to the slave processor. When we pulled the connection off, we found that the communication worked on the serial monitors without LCD.
