We will need to test the correctness of the calculation, if the calculator can output proper error information when the input is invalid, and the robustness for different kinds of invalid inputs.For phase 2, first, we will need to test all the cases required in phase 1. Apart from that, we will also need to test if the calculator makes the 1-digit number input as invalid.For phase 3, all tests in phase 2 must be repeated in this phase. Meanwhile, handling on the input of positive and negative sign is necessary in the test plan of this phase. In the test plan for two processors, we will need to test if the bytes are correctly transferred from the master processor to the slave processor as well as all the tests in phase 3.
