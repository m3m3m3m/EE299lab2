\subsection{Brief Design Specification}
\subsubsection{Overall summary description of the module}
This module should function as a calculator and be designed by ourselves. The input should be received from the serial monitor on a PC connected to the Arduino board, and the output should be both displayed on the serial monitor and a LCD screen connected to the board. The input digits and symbols and result should be displayed on the LCD screen in a specified format. Also, data transfer between two Arduino boards should be reflected on the module design.
